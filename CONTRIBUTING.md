# Style

Below are some style guidlines for various parts of the project, these are not all inclusive so feel free to open a PR if you feel like something is missing!

## Issues

All issue titles should be as short and sweet as possible while maintaining coherence some examples are

- ✅ [BUG] Crash when entering dungeon on level one
- ❌ Game wont run
- ✅ Create new test level for 3D sprites
- ❌ Testing things

Issue bodies should contain more information about what is going wrong or what needs to be done and the comments should be used for conversation about that topic. When in doubt use one of the templates if it applies
